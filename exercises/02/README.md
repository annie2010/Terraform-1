# Exercise #2: Using Variables

* For this exercise, we will revisit the terraform project from the previous exercise

* There are a few ways to accomplish our goal in this exercise, so try doing each one independently
  * If you get stuck or have questions, let your instructor know

### Looking at the variable stanza

* In order to leverage the variable concept in terraform, you must *declare* each variable.

* We have a single variable defined in our `variables.tf` file like so:

```hcl
# Declare a variable so we can use it.
variable "student_alias" {
  description = "Your student alias"
}
```

*(Note: We don't have to have a variables.tf fileâ€“we could just as well put all variables, resources, 
outputs, etc. into one file, but it's considered best practice to maintain different files for variables,
outputs, and resources.)*

* The name of the variable above would be `student_alias`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The possible properties of a variable:

1. `default`: allows for setting a default value, otherwise terraform requires it to be set:
    * via the CLI (`-var student_alias=my-alias`), 
    * defined in a `*.tfvars` file
    * defined in an environment variable like `TF_VAR_[variable name]`
    * or it will prompt for the input
2. `description`: a useful descriptor for the variable
3. `type`: we'll discuss types in depth later

* We've only set the description, so there's no default value, and it will use the default type of: `string`.

### Adding the values statically in the variables stanza.

* notice that there is no `value` parameter in the syntax for the variable object  
  * variables stanzas are not meant to be inputs themselves, but rather placeholders
that handle input and allow for reference throughout the working directory
* while variable stanzas can be used this way by simply setting the `default` to the desired value, this 
negates the benefits of Terraform's native re-usability
* instead, try using one of the below methods...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Initialization

* Every time a new terraform working directory is created, we need to initialize it
  * Why? We need to prepare it to run against the designated external API  
* before continuing, make sure you're in the same directory as this `README`

```bash
terraform init
```

you should get an output similar to this:

```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (terraform-providers/aws) 2.XX.0...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

* init noticed we had a reference to AWS resources in our HCL
   * namely, we defined the AWS provider

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0" # meaning any non-beta version >= 2.0 and < 3.0
}
```

* init must downloads the necessary providers to the `.terraform` directory locally so that further plans and applies can use it

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### `tfvars` file

* in each terraform directory, there can be a file named `terraform.tfvars` (or `*.auto.tfvars`) that contains 
HCL that defines values for variables for that working directory
* tfvar files can also be referenced via command line

* let's try a few things:
  * create a file called `terraform.tfvars` in this directory
  * insert the following code into it:
```hcl
# swap "[your alias]" with your provided alias
student_alias = "[your alias]"
```
  * then run this in the same directory
```bash
terraform plan
``` 

* you should see that the `terraform plan` output includes an s3 bucket, and that the value for `bucket_name`
utilizes your chosen identifying text

* Remove your `terraform.tfvars` file so we can look at other ways of passing in the variable:

```
rm terraform.tfvars
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Command Line Arguments

* another way to set variables is via the CLI
  * doing so allows for quick variable substitution and testing because values entered via CLI _override values from other methods_

* run the following in this working directory, swapping for your
identifier like before:

```bash
terraform plan -var 'student_alias=[your alias]'
```

* try using a different identifier to see if it worked
  * just as before, you should be able to see the  new identifier in the plan output

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Using Environment variables

* environment variables can be used to set the value of an input variable
  * the name of the environment variable must be `TF_VAR_` followed by the variable name
  * the value is the value of the variable

* try the following:

```bash
TF_VAR_student_alias=[your alias] terraform plan 
```

* (This can be a useful method for handling secrets, or other automated use cases)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Prompt for a variable value

* try just running the plan without having a pre-populated value set:

```
terraform plan
```

* ...the above should prompt you for your `student_alias` value
  * this is the final way in which a variable can be set, i.e., at runtime

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Locals

* a related concept that we'll get into a bit more a little later is something called a `local`
* locals act like variables, in that they can be referenced from multiple locations
  * ...but locals can't take inputs like variables
* locals also allow for interpolation, like merging strings or basing a value on chained dependencies of locals
* locals act more like the standard variables you might be working with in Python or other languages
  * example:

```hcl
locals {
  title = "Student"
  name = "${var.student_alias}"
  name_and_title = "${local.name} - ${local.title}"
}
```

* We'll stop here for now
  * We'll begin actually working with applying these plans in our next exercise.
